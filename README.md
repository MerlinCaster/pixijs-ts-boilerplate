# pixijs-ts-boilerplate

Just another PixiJS Typescript Boilerplate

## Getting Started

Another boilerplate to speed up project setup for developing typescript apps with PixiJS.
Ready to compile code for dev and production env. 
Provides a helper class (PixiApp) to manage resizing (full size, keeping aspect ratio or no resize at all),
alignment of the stage within the canvas view, toggle [fullscreen](https://github.com/sindresorhus/screenfull.js/),
display some media info and a [fps-meter](https://github.com/darsain/fpsmeter).

Versions:
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 2.6.1
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) 3.8.1
- [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com/) 4.5.6

### Prerequisites

Install Node & NPM from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or using [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

### Installing

Choose one of the following options:

* Export the project with svn

```
svn export https://github.com/dacaher/pixijs-ts-boilerplate/trunk/
```

* Download it as [ZIP](https://github.com/dacaher/pixijs-ts-boilerplate/archive/master.zip)

* Clone the git repo â€” `git clone https://github.com/dacaher/pixijs-ts-boilerplate.git` and checkout the
[tagged release](https://github.com/dacaher/pixijs-ts-boilerplate/releases) you'd like to use.


Edit package.json to change project details.

Install NPM dependencies by running.

```
npm install
```
 
## Initial Steps

- Test it by running and browsing to [localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000/) 
```
npm run build && npm run serve
```
You should see a sample app with a fps-meter and a div containing some display info.

- See src/sample-app for a showcase.
- Edit src/html/index.html, src/scripts/index.ts and src/styles/style.css as desired.
Index.ts is the entry point for bundling the application.
- Instantiate App with parameters width, height, align, resize and a canvas view container if required.
- Optionally add/remove custom linter rules from tslint.json.
- Finally remove src/sample-app and assets/gfx/* when not needed.

Note that pixi.js is kept as a external dependency and it is not bundled within the application.
Not really sure if I should bundle it as well.

## NPM scripts

- clean - [removes](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) dev, dist and doc dirs
- build - compiles and copy all the assets to dev dir
- build:release - compiles and [uglifies](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin) to dist dir
- serve - serves (0.0.0.0:9000) dev dir with Hot Module Replacement enabled through [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
- serve:dash - same as serve with a fancy interface thanks to [webpack-dashboard](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard)
- serve:release - serves (0.0.0.0:9999) dist dir through [http-server](https://github.com/indexzero/http-server) to test production bundle
- test - does nothing right now
- doc - generate app doc with [typedoc](http://typedoc.org/)

## TODO List

- [ ] Add some ts testing framework.
- [ ] Replace npm with yarn?
- [x] Bundle (s)css styles within the app.
- [ ] Remove webpack-dashboard plugin to cut some dependencies. (Not really used anyways)
- [ ] Display some device info (cpu, ram, etc.) through the Media Info Viewer if possible.
- [x] Try to avoid relative paths for importing modules (../../..) if possible.
- [ ] Extract global declarations from the index file to its own file.

## Contributing

As a fairly new developer with Typescript (and javascript ecosystems in general) any suggestion, bug report or improvement submitted would be very much appreciated.
